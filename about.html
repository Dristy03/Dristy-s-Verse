            "Some people think that design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, 
            it's really how it works." â€“ Steve Job has said it rightfully. Design is a bigger and stronger 
            thing than we give credit to. I am a young passionate and ambitious UI designer who is also a developer 
            and programmer. I love to design since my childhood. As I am from Computer Science and Engineering 
            background, I have come across to UI designing. Moreover, I love to develop android applications.
